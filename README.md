# Machine-Learning-ClassificationTools-RealWorldData

This is a comparison between some Machine Learning classification tools and their accuracy results.

The data set (in the Data.csv file) is a real world data set that I pulled from the UCI machine learning repository and this data set is about breast cancer.
Each row in this data set represents a patient and for every patient we have the following independent variables(features), Sample Code number,
Clump thickness, Uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial cell, Bare nuclei, Bland Chromatin,
Normal Nucleoli, Mitoses, and for the dependent variable we have class which contains binary results. All those independent variables or f
eatures predict whether the patient will have a class of 2 (benign) or 4(malignant).
